# Adult Census Income Classification

## Overview

This project implements a complete Machine Learning pipeline on the **Adult Census Income Dataset** to predict whether an individual's annual income exceeds **$50K** based on demographic and employment-related attributes. The project covers data understanding, preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, and performance evaluation using multiple classification algorithms.

---

## Dataset

The dataset contains demographic and employment information collected from the **1994 U.S. Census Database**. The objective is to classify whether a person's annual income is:

- **<=50K**
- **>50K**

### Dataset Source

- UCI Machine Learning Repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult
- Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/adult-census-income

The dataset contains approximately **32,561 records** and **15 attributes**.

## Problem Statement

Predict whether an individual's annual income exceeds **$50,000** using demographic and employment-related features.

This is a **Supervised Binary Classification** problem.
